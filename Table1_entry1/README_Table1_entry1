2. moe206 Descriptor file

test_108VS147_moe206.csv  is the moe206 descriptor for test_108VS147.csv
train_1004VS1385_moe206.csv  is the moe206 descriptor for train_1004VS1385.csv

3. Predict probability result

1). 
file P_test_moe2060.csv is the prediction result for test dataset by the D-MPNN+moe206 model which was trained by train_1004VS1385.csv dataset and feature file train_1004VS1385_moe206.csv in first run of  the 5 fold cross-validation

P_test_moe2061.csv, P_test_moe2062.csv,P_test_moe2063.csv and P_test_moe2064.csv are the results of rest 4 run in the 5 fold cross-validation

2). 
file P_test_noFP0.csv is the prediction result for test dataset by the D-MPNN model without additional descriptor which was trained by train_1004VS1385.csv dataset in first run of  the 5 fold cross-validation

P_test_noFP1.csv, P_test_noFP2.csv, P_test_noFP3.csv and P_test_noFP4.csv are the results of rest 4 run in the 5 fold cross-validation
