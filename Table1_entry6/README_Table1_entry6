2. moe206 Descriptor file
note: two file compressed zip file becasue its relative big size.
unzip using following commands:


unzip test87366_moe206.csv.zip
this will give  the orginal the  test87366_moe206.csv


zip -F train203853_moe206.csv.zip --out single-archive.zip
unzip single-archive.zip
this will give the orginal the train203853_moe206.csv

test87366_moe206.csv  is the moe206 descriptor for test87366.csv
train203853_moe206.csv  is the moe206 descriptor for train203853.csv

3. Predict probability result

1). 
file P_test87366_moe2060.csv is the prediction result for test dataset by the D-MPNN+moe206 model which was trained by train203853.csv dataset and feature file train203853_moe206.csv in first run of  the 5 fold cross-validation

P_test87366_moe2061.csv, P_test87366_moe2062.csv, P_test87366_moe2063.csv and P_test87366_moe2064.csv are the results of rest 4 run in the 5 fold cross-validation

2). 
file P_test87366_noFP0.csv is the prediction result for test dataset by the D-MPNN model without additional descriptor which was trained by train203853.csv dataset in first run of  the 5 fold cross-validation

P_test87366_noFP1.csv, P_test87366_noFP2.csv, P_test87366_noFP3.csv and P_test87366_noFP4.csv are the results of rest 4 run in the 5 fold cross-validation


4.  Results of evaluting performance

1)
file eva_test87366_P_test87366_moe2060.csv is results of evaluting performance by the D-MPNN+moe206 model which was trained by test87366.csv dataset in first run of  the 5 fold cross-validation

eva_test87366_P_test87366_moe2061.csv, eva_test87366_P_test87366_moe2062.csv, eva_test87366_P_test87366_moe2063.csv and eva_test87366_P_test87366_moe2064.csv are the results of rest 4 run in the 5 fold cross-validation


2)
file eva_test87366_P_test87366_noFP0.csv is results of evaluting performance by the D-MPNN model without additional descriptor which was trained by test87366.csv dataset in first run of  the 5 fold cross-validation

eva_test87366_P_test87366_noFP1.csv, eva_test87366_P_test87366_noFP2.csv, eva_test87366_P_test87366_noFP3.csv and eva_test87366_P_test87366_noFP4.csv are the results of rest 4 run in the 5 fold cross-validation
